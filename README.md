# Overview

This repo contains demonstrations of using the DBCNet to identify the Raman spectra with different GSH and H2O2 concentrations. The Raman spectral dataset here contains the training set, validation set and test set randomly divided from 9600 spectra mentioned in the paper.


## Requirements

The code in this repo has been tested with the following software versions:
- Python 3.7.16
- Tensorflow 2.7.0
- Keras 2.7.0
- Scikit-Learn 1.0.2
- Numpy 1.21.6
- Scipy 1.7.3
- Matplotlib 3.5.2


## How to use the package

1. Run the file "train.py" to train and evaluate the DBCNet model.
